    "# Persona Pattern Example\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the **Persona Pattern**, a technique where you assign a specific expert identity to the AI to improve domain-specific responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Concept:**\n",
    "By instructing the AI to \"act as\" a specific expert (doctor, lawyer, chef, etc.), you activate relevant knowledge and communication styles. This technique:\n",
    "* Improves accuracy for domain-specific tasks\n",
    "* Creates more natural, contextually appropriate responses\n",
    "* Helps maintain consistency across conversations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Mechanics:**\n",
    "1. **Role Assignment**: Define who the AI should be (expertise, experience, style).\n",
    "2. **Context Setting**: Provide background that shapes responses.\n",
    "3. **Behavioral Guidelines**: Specify how the persona should communicate.\n",
    "4. **Constraints**: Define what the persona should and shouldn't do."
