    "# Few-Shot Prompting Example\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates **Few-Shot Prompting**, a technique that allows you to \"teach\" the AI a new task without any model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Concept:**\n",
    "Most LLMs are \"Zero-Shot\" learners, meaning they can answer questions without examples. However, for specific formats, styles, or complex logic, they perform much better if you provide a few examples of **Input → Output** pairs in the prompt. This is called **In-Context Learning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Mechanics:**\n",
    "1.  **Examples**: We provide 3–5 high-quality examples of the task (e.g., \"Input: A, Output: B\").\n",
    "2.  **Pattern Recognition**: The model looks at these examples, infers the rule, and applies it to your new input.\n",
    "3.  **Result**: Better formatting, tone consistency, and accuracy for specialized tasks (like translating to \"Pirate English\" or extracting data to JSON)."
