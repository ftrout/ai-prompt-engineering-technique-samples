    "# Graph of Thought (GoT) Prompting Example\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates **Graph of Thought (GoT)**, one of the most advanced reasoning frameworks for LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Concept:**\n",
    "Standard \"Chain of Thought\" is linear (Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3). **Graph of Thought** models reasoning as a network (DAG - Directed Acyclic Graph).\n",
    "* **Nodes**: Individual thoughts or intermediate steps.\n",
    "* **Edges**: Relationships (e.g., \"Step 1 *supports* Step 2\", \"Step 3 *contradicts* Step 1\").\n",
    "* **Transformations**: Thoughts can merge (aggregation), split (branching), or loop back (refinement).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Mechanics:**\n",
    "1.  **Prompting for Structure**: We force the LLM to output its reasoning as a **JSON** object containing `nodes` and `edges`.\n",
    "2.  **Parsing**: We read this structured output to understand the relationship between thoughts.\n",
    "3.  **Visualization**: We can potentially map or display this network to see how the model arrived at the answer."

    "### 2. The GoT Function (The \"Network Builder\")\n",
    "\n",
    "This function performs the heavy lifting:\n",
    "1.  **Prompting**: It sends a strict instruction to the model to output JSON only.\n",
    "2.  **Parsing**: It cleans the raw string (removing Markdown backticks) and converts it to a Python dictionary.\n",
    "3.  **Graph Construction**: It uses the `networkx` library to actually build the graph object in memory, adding nodes and connecting them with edges."
