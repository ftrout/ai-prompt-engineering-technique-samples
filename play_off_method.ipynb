    "# Play Off Method Example\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the **Play Off Method**, a creative prompting technique designed for brainstorming and ideation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Concept:**\n",
    "In a creative jam session, people often \"play off\" each other's ideas—taking a concept and flipping it, combining it with something unrelated, or iterating on it to make it better. This prompt forces the AI to simulate that dynamic process internally before presenting a final concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Mechanics:**\n",
    "1.  **Base Idea**: You provide a simple starting point.\n",
    "2.  **Play Off**: The model generates variations by:\n",
    "    * **Contrasting**: Finding the opposite or \"anti-version.\"\n",
    "    * **Combining**: Merging it with a random or distinct field.\n",
    "    * **Refining**: Polishing the best version.\n",
    "3.  **Result**: A highly creative, often unexpected output that goes beyond a standard \"make this better\" request."
