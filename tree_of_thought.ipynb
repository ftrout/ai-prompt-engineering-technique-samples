    "\n",
    "**The Concept:**\n",
    "While \"Chain of Thought\" explores one linear path, **Tree of Thought** explores multiple possible \"branches\" of reasoning simultaneously. It's like having a team of experts brainstorm different solutions, evaluate the pros and cons of each, and vote on the best one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Mechanics:**\n",
    "1.  **Branching**: The model generates 3–5 distinct approaches to the problem.\n",
    "2.  **Evaluation**: It critiques each approach (Pros/Cons) and assigns a score.\n",
    "3.  **Selection**: It compares the branches and synthesizes the final recommendation based on the highest-scoring logic."
