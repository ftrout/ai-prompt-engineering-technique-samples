    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates **ReAct (Reason + Act)**, a technique that combines \"Chain of Thought\" reasoning with \"Action\" execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Concept:**\n",
    "Humans solve problems by interleaving thinking and acting. We think \"I need to check the weather,\" we look it up (Act), we see it's raining (Observe), and then we think \"I should take an umbrella\" (Reason).\n",
    "ReAct forces the LLM to follow this exact cycle: **Thought → Action → Observation → Thought...**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Mechanics:**\n",
    "1.  **Thought**: The model analyzes the current situation.\n",
    "2.  **Action**: It decides on a specific tool or step to take next (e.g., \"Search Wikipedia\").\n",
    "3.  **Observation**: It looks at the result of that action (in this specific demo, we ask the model to *simulate* the observation to show the flow).\n",
    "4.  **Repeat**: This loop continues until the final answer is found."

    "In a production system, you would write code to parse the \"Action\" and actually execute a Python function or API call.
