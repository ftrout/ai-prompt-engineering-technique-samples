    "# Self-Consistency Prompting Example\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates **Self-Consistency**, a technique that improves accuracy on reasoning tasks by \"asking the audience\" (where the audience is the model itself).\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Concept:**\n",
    "LLMs are probabilistic. If you ask a complex question once, it might take a wrong turn in its reasoning.\n",
    "**Self-Consistency** mitigates this by:\n",
    "1.  **Sampling**: Asking the *same* question multiple times (e.g., 5 times).\n",
    "2.  **Reasoning**: Letting the model generate a full Chain of Thought for each attempt.\n",
    "3.  **Voting**: Comparing the final answers and selecting the one that appears most frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Mechanics:**\n",
    "* **Diversity**: We use a non-zero temperature to ensure each reasoning path is slightly different.\n",
    "* **Consensus**: If 4 out of 5 reasoning paths lead to \"Answer: 42,\" we can be much more confident than if we only asked once."

    "\n",
    "This function runs the core logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "1.  **Loop**: It runs a loop `num_samples` times (default is 5).\n",
    "2.  **Generate**: It calls the API for each sample.\n",
    "    * **Crucial Detail**: We set `temperature=0.7`. If we used 0, every answer would be identical, defeating the purpose. We need slight variations in the reasoning path to test robustness.\n",
    "3.  **Extract**: It parses the model's output to find the final answer (assuming the answer is on the last line).\n",
    "4.  **Vote**: It uses `Counter` to find the most common result."
