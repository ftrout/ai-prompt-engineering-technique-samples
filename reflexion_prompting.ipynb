    "This notebook demonstrates **Reflexion**, a powerful technique for self-correction and iterative improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Concept:**\n",
    "Humans rarely get complex problems right on the first try. We draft, review, catch errors, and revise. **Reflexion** gives the AI this same ability. Instead of accepting the first answer, the model:\n",
    "1.  **Attempts** to solve the problem.\n",
    "2.  **Evaluates** its own work (or receives feedback).\n",
    "3.  **Reflects** on *why* it might be wrong (e.g., \"I missed a constraint\").\n",
    "4.  **Retries** with this new insight.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Mechanics:**\n",
    "* **The Solver**: A model instance trying to answer the query.\n",
    "* **The Reflector**: A model instance (often the same one) critiquing the previous attempt.\n",
    "* **The Loop**: A cycle of *Attempt → Critique → Reflect → Retry* that continues until a valid answer is found or a limit is reached."

    "\n",
    "This function encapsulates the entire self-correction loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "1.  **History**: We keep a list of `reflections` (lessons learned from past failures).\n",
    "2.  **Prompting**: In every attempt, we inject the *previous reflections* into the prompt. This forces the model to specifically avoid repeating its past mistakes.\n",
    "3.  **Self-Check**: If the model doesn't output a specific success tag (`<FINAL_ANSWER>`), we assume it's still reasoning or unsure, and we trigger a specific \"Reflection Prompt\" to analyze what went wrong."
